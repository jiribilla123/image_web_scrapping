# Image web scrapping for local ERP

This is my first project of web scrapping
I had to upload >2,500 images of our products to the local ERP.
The process was to extract the product codes from our ERP, identify them by supplier code standard (xxxx-xxxx)
Then searching each product in the suppliers web page and downlading the images using the product code as image name
Next step was to login and search each product based on image name and update it.

Since the script worked just fine I decided to upload it.
I added some comments for better understanding and will be working on better structure of it 
Also this was a one-case script but will contiue updating so that it can be run constantly to add new product images.

I'm kind of new in python and I felt so happy when I saw it work
I'm excited to share this! Feel free to reach out for suggestions.
