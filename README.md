# Image web scrapping for local ERP

This is my first project of web scrapping.<br>
I had to upload >2,500 images of our products to the local ERP.<br>
The process was to extract the product codes from our ERP, identify them by supplier code standard (xxxx-xxxx)
Then searching each product in the suppliers web page and downlading the images using the product code as image name.<br>
Next step was to login and search each product based on image name and update it.

Since the script worked just fine I decided to upload it.<br>
I added some comments for better understanding and will be working on better structure of it.<br>
Also this was a one-case script but will contiue updating so that it can be run constantly to add new product images.<br>

I'm kind of new in python and I felt so happy when I saw it work<br>
I'm excited to share this! Feel free to reach out for suggestions.<br>
